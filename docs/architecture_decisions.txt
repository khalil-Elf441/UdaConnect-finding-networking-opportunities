UdaConnect system is composed of four main microsevices:

1.2. LocationService

The Location Service implements one of the main SOLID principles in object-oriented design, namely the principle of single responsibility, which means that the Location Service manages and processes only the data that depends on the location data. not the Connection Service in monolithic architecture.
The location service provides a REST API capable of simple HTTP-based interactions. Since we expect a large volume of location data to be provided by clients and tracking their locations, it is linked to the Kafka queue to produce new locations that need to be inserted into the Kafka queue.
Kafka builds on the fault tolerance capabilities it allows to handle a large volume of requests and helps to reduce the load of persisting the new location to the database.
As the location service is the central service responsible for processing location-related data, it also responds to the ConnectionService to allow it to build its query

1.3. LocationProcessor

The location processor is used to retrieve new location data from the Kafka queue and write it to the database. 
To facilitate the management of this service, the administrator can start /start, stop /destroy, or know the status of the /status microservice, by HTTP GET/POST requests.

1.4. ConnectionService

The connection service is used to respond to client requests for connections between people.
The connection service builds its request and retrieves information from other services (LocationService, PersonService)
it makes its requests to the PersonService using the gRPC protocol which provides a high response time.

1.5. PersonService

the person service provides the data for the clients through the HTTP protocol.
it is also a grpc server that responds to the requests of the connection service through the grpc achieving better performance with small serialized protobuf messages.
